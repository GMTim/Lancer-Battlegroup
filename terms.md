## Accurate
Attacks made with this weapon gain `+1 ACCURACY`.
## Area-Target
Area-target attacks do not require an attack roll. Instead, they automatically hit the target battlegroup and roll damage, which can then be reduced by `INTERDICTION`.  
When making an area-target attack, the attack’s damage is rolled, then the total `INTERDICTION` of the target battlegroup is rolled and the result subtracted from the damage. Whatever damage remains is then applied to all ships in the battlegroup except for `WINGS`, which are small and nimble enough to evade them automatically.
## Boarding
This weapon or upgrade can participate in boarding actions. Many `ESCORTS` and `WINGS` can perform boarding actions in addition to their other activities. While boarding a ship, these units are removed from play and can’t regain `HP`, take damage, or be targeted by attacks or effects unless specifically noted.
## Charge X
This weapon begins play with `X CHARGE COUNTERS`, which indicates how close they are to being fully charged. During each `Logistics Phase`, all `CHARGE` weapons automatically remove `1 CHARGE COUNTER`. CHARGE weapons that have reached `0 CHARGE COUNTERS` can be fired during the `Impact Phase`, which resets their counters to `X`. Firing a `CHARGE` weapon does not require a maneuver or tactic.
## Critical
This weapon is especially devastating or capable of penetrating a target’s defenses to strike vulnerable components with careful aim and a bit of luck. Its attacks can critically hit, dealing double damage when `20+` is rolled on an attack roll.
## Greywash
This insidious weapon or munition infests targets and gradually breaks them down. `GREYWASH` weapons often make use of destructive nanotech swarms, but they can take a range of similar forms as well, such as drones or lingering munitions. `GREYWASH` upgrades inflict their targets with `GREYWASH COUNTERS`. At the end of the Impact Phase, ships take damage equal to the number of `GREYWASH COUNTERS` they currently have (ignoring `OVERSHIELD`) and then remove `1 GREYWASH COUNTER`. These counters can stack. Battlegroups can automatically clear all `GREYWASH COUNTERS` from their ships as a maneuver.
## Legionspace
This weapon or upgrade is connected to the fleet legion in some way. It can be used to disrupt enemy vessels or to unleash systemic, paracausal attacks upon opposed fleet legions, which, in turn, affects targets in realspace. `LEGIONSPACE` weapons, systems, and upgrades function as normal, but can be uniquely bolstered or hindered by some effects.
## Limited X
This weapon or system can only be used X times before it is fully expended. To use the system, the user expends a use. Limited weapons expend uses when used to attack.
## Payload X
This weapon does not require an attack roll to hit its targets. Instead, there is a delay between when they’re fired and when they hit their target; the longer the distance, the longer the flight time. When fired, `PAYLOAD` attacks start with a number of `FLIGHT COUNTERS` based on the attacker’s range band (see pp. XX–XX for flight times). `FLIGHT COUNTERS` are removed during the `Logistics Phase` of each round. Once the final `FLIGHT COUNTER` is removed, impact is imminent and the attack hits its target in the `Impact Phase`. Most `PAYLOAD` attacks can be interdicted.  
`PAYLOAD X` weapons are slower or faster than usual, adding or subtracting `X FLIGHT COUNTERS`. A weapon with `PAYLOAD –1`, for example, starts with `1` less `FLIGHT COUNTER` than usual. Some abilities and effects can also increase or decrease the flight time of PAYLOAD attacks, down to a minimum of `1 FLIGHT COUNTER` – a `PAYLOAD’S FLIGHT COUNTERS` cannot be reduced to `0` before the `Logistics Phase`.
## Reloading X
Although this weapon or upgrade doesn’t necessarily require literal reloading, it does have to refresh, recharge, or cool down between uses. After use, gains `X REFRESH COUNTERS`, with one counter removed in each subsequent `Logistics Phase`. When the last `REFRESH COUNTER` is removed, it is ready to be used again.
## Single-Target
Attacks from single-target weapons must be against individual targets. If they hit, then they deal damage; if they miss, they don’t. Single-target attacks cannot be interdicted unless they are from `PAYLOAD` weapons.
## Unique
This weapon or system is especially rare or unconventional and cannot be assigned casually – each battlegroup may only equip a single instance of it at a time.
