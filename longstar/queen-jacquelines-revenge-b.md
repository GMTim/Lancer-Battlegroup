## Traits
> ### LAST ARGUMENT OF KINGS
> _Trait_  
> This ship must have at least one `SUPERHEAVY CHARGE` weapon.

> ### OVERCHARGE CAPACITORS
> _Trait_  
> This ship can pour more power into its long-spool weapons than is strictly advisable. Whenever you remove a `CHARGE COUNTER` from one of its `SUPERHEAVY` weapons, you may choose to take `1 damage` and give that weapon an `OVERCHARGE COUNTER`, up to a maximum of `4 OVERCHARGE COUNTERS`. This damage cannot be prevented in any way, but cannot reduce the ship below `1 HP`. When you fire a weapon with `OVERCHARGE COUNTERS`, remove all `OVERCHARGE COUNTERS` from it and deal an additional `+1d3 damage` on hit for each counter removed this way.

## Tactics
> ### MAXIMUM POWER
> _Tactic, [Limited](../terms.md#limited-x) 1_  
> One of this ship’s `SUPERHEAVY` weapons with the `CHARGE` tag immediately removes all `CHARGE COUNTERS` and gains `4 OVERCHARGE COUNTERS`, up to a maximum of `4`. The next attack made with that weapon gains `+4 RELIABLE`, but afterwards is destroyed and cannot be used again for the rest of the battle. When you use this tactic, this ship immediately takes `4 damage` that cannot be prevented in any way, but which cannot reduce it below `1 HP`.

## Systems
> ### PREDICT/OVERLAY SHIELD PROJECTOR
> _0 points_  
> _System, [Limited](../terms.md#limited-x) 1, [Unique](../terms.md#unique)_  
> During the `Impact Phase`, you may reduce incoming damage assigned to a `CAPITAL SHIP` in your battlegroup from a `SUPERHEAVY` weapon by `6`. At `range 5`, this damage reduction is increased to `10` instead.

> ### BRACE FOR IMPACT
> _0 points_  
> _System, [Limited](../terms.md#limited-x) 1, [Unique](../terms.md#unique)_  
> Choose one:  
>
>> You may activate this system during the Impact Phase after attacks have been rolled and damage has been assigned: all damage taken by ships in your battlegroup is reduced by half until the end of your next turn. You may not use any tactics or perform any maneuvers during your next turn except for ALL AHEAD FULL or RETROGRADE BURN.
>
> Or
>
>> You may use the following tactic during your turn:
>> ### BRACE FOR IMPACT
>> _Tactic, [Limited](../terms.md#limited-x) 1_  
>> Your battlegroup becomes BOLSTERED until the end of your next turn.

## Superheavy Weapons
> ### SPINAL PETAJOULE KINETIC
> _2 points_  
> _Superheavy, [Single-Target](../terms.md#single-target), [Accurate](../terms.md#accurate), [Charge](../terms.md#charge-x) 3, [Critical](../terms.md#critical)_  
> _`Range 5-2`, `15 damage`_  
> Hit or miss, while assigning damage after firing this weapon during the `Impact Phase`, it deals `5 damage` to a different `CAPITAL SHIP` or `ESCORT` in its target’s battlegroup. If there are no other targets in the battlegroup to choose from, this ability has no effect.

> ### CO-CONSCIOUSNESS LANCE
> _3 points_  
> _Superheavy, [Area-Target](../terms.md#area-target), [Legionspace](../terms.md#legionspace), [Reloading](../terms.md#reloading-x) 3_  
> `_Range 4-2`, `2d6+2 damage`_  
> This devastating systemic attack shatters an enemy fleet legion’s cohesion and deals `+2 damage` for each `non-TEMPLATE ESCORT` in the target battlegroup. After taking damage from this weapon, that battlegroup chooses one:
>
>>They must take the first NPC turn in the next Action Phase, but all rolls they make receive `+1 DIFFICULTY`. They must act last in the next `Action Phase`, after everyone else.
>
> If multiple battlegroups suffer from this disruption effect at once, they choose a viable turn order as needed.

## Primary Weapons
> ### DARKSTAR MULTIPLE-WARHEAD TORPEDOES
> _2 points_  
> _Primary, [Area-Target](../terms.md#area-target), [Payload](../terms.md#payload-x) –1_  
> _`Range 4–2`, `6 damage`_  
> If this weapon’s damage is not completely interdicted, it deals +1d6 damage after INTERDICTION.
